# Update README to indicate this repo is archived and replaced

**brikis98** commented *Oct 4, 2022*

This repo contains sample code for the [Comprehensive Guide to Terraform blog post series](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca). As part of turning that series into the book _[Terraform: Up & Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/)_, I created a separate repo with code samples: https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code. It doesn't really make sense to spend lots of time maintaining both repos, so I propose archiving this one, and only maintaining https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code going forward.
