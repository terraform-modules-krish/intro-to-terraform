# cluster-of-web servers

**aloknj** commented *Mar 28, 2019*

I tried to use code for cluster-of-web-servers.
Few resources were created successfully, but not all.

I keep getting this error, do you know why this is happening. It says issue is with configuration not supported.

Error: Error applying plan:

What is your configuration? What instance type are you using? Perhaps the region/AZ you're in doesn't support that instance type?
