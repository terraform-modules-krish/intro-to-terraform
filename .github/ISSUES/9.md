# Syntax error in blog post?

**IshwarBhat** commented *Aug 1, 2019*

I was experimenting with workspaces in https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-terraform-state-28f5697e68fa (great set of blog posts btw, thanks!) and tried this piece of code:
```HCL
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = 
    terraform.workspace == "default" 
    ? "t2.medium" 
    : "t2.micro"
}
```
which gave me an error:

> Error: Argument or block definition required
> 
>   on main.tf line 29, in resource "aws_instance" "example":
>   29:         terraform.workspace == "default"
> 
> An argument or block definition is required here. To set an argument, use the
> equals sign "=" to introduce the argument value.

Modifying the above code to this fixed my issue:
```HCL
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
    instance_type = "${
        terraform.workspace == "default"
        ? "t2.medium"
        : "t2.micro"
    }"
}
```

Thanks for the heads up! I wrapped that snippet so that it fit better into the blog post, but putting a new line after the equals sign turns out not to be valid HCL2 syntax. I just fixed it in the blog post as follows:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = (
    terraform.workspace == "default" 
    ? "t2.medium" 
    : "t2.micro"
  )
}
```
