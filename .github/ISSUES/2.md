# cluster server issue

**dmccuk** commented *Oct 12, 2016*

Hi,
I'm new to terraform and have been following your guide. I've got the single webserver code running but when I try and run the cluster web servers, I get the following errors. I'm pretty sure I've missed something out!

cluster-of-web-servers]$ terraform plan
Error configuring: 2 error(s) occurred:
- aws_autoscaling_group.example: missing dependency: data.aws_availability_zones
- aws_elb.example: missing dependency: data.aws_availability_zones

Can you point me in the right direction please? I did a git clone, set my own access/secret key and ran the terraform plan.

Regards

<br />

Hmm, the `data.aws_availability_zones` data source is defined right here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/intro-to-terraform/blob/master/cluster-of-web-servers/main.tf#L22

What version of Terraform do you have installed? Data sources were only added in Terraform 0.7.x.

Your right. My fault! I'm using version 6. I've updated and now it's working for me. Thanks.
