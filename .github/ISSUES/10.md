# Can't see how you're incorporating the S3 backend

Hi,
 Great blogs, they have been extremely helpful!

I might be missing something in your example tree here, but I do not see how you are using the S3 backend in any of the examples?

Thanks

Can you include specific code snippets and/or links, and we'll try to help you out?

To make these examples easy to try out (i.e., without having to create/configure an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table), we don't specify a `backend` configuration. However, if you want to try it out, see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/intro-to-terraform/tree/master/s3-backend for creating the S3 bucket + DynamoDB table and https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-terraform-state-28f5697e68fa for how to configure a `backend` to use them.

Hi @brikis98, That makes sense. I was looking at the blog and the examples and didn't see where or how you integrated the backend.

Thanks!
