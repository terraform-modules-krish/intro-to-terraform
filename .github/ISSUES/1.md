# Single-web-server raises error

simply running terraform apply in the single-web-server directory raises:

@marcofognog The template should deploy into the default VPC in your AWS account. Is it possible you don't have one? Did you delete it? 

If so, you'll have to specify the `subnet_id` parameter and point it to one of the subnets in a non-default VPC.
